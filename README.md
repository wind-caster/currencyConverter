# currencyConverter
This project was created as part of the ONE (Oracle Next Education) program. It consists of a simple program that requests data from an exchange-rates API and converts currencies according to user input.

1.The program prompts the user to input the actual currency, the currency they want to convert to, and the amount of money.

2.The program then fetches the data necessary from "https://www.exchangerate-api.com/".

3.Lastly the program converts the data according to the user request and prints it on screen.

The program was designed to be maintainable and expandable (to the project's extents), the code can be easily modified to expand the available currencies.
